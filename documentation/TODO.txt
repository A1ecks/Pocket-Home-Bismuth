-Refine the AppMenuComponent interface to allow for more flexible menu variants
  What's left to fix:
    Desktop entries no longer sorted after name changes
        DesktopEntryMenuItem isn't marked as a DesktopEntries editor?
    Right clicking on page doesn't bring up the generic menu anymore
    Scrolling menu doesn't correctly scale text when recycling menu buttons
    Scrolling menu fails to automatically select index 0 when opening a new 
        folder.
-Decrease coupling between AppMenuComponent and subclasses
    AppMenuComponent subclasses shouldn't need direct access to all
    AppMenuFolders
