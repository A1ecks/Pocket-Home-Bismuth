-Refine the AppMenuComponent interface to allow for more flexible menu variants
  What's left to fix:
    Re-implement scrolling menu
    Desktop entries no longer sorted after name changes
        DesktopEntryMenuItem isn't marked as a DesktopEntries editor?
    Paged menu has no page close button
    Right clicking on page doesn't bring up the generic menu anymore
    Paged menu animations need some tweaks
    
-Make bluetooth work and properly implement the bluetooth page


-Re-add the IP label to the Settings Page (or optionally, the homepage)

-Define page background color/image in config

-more options for updating the config within the UI

-localization support

-configurable keyboard shortcuts

-More thorough implementation of the Desktop entry standard

-Add an icon selection page that uses IconThread's index of icon files
