-Wifi thread upgrades:
    Wifi page behaves strangely when WifiStatusNM can't find wlan0
    WifiStatus should be a private thread with methods to start and stop the
        thread.
    Replace WifiAccessPoint::null() with the default constructor.
    WifiStatus needs access control ScopedLocks

-IconThread should be globally available and protected with ScopedLocks.
Alternatively, generating the icon map isn't as slow as it used to be, consider
regenerating it occasionally rather than adding another global resource.
-Add an icon selection page that uses IconThread's index of icon files

-AppMenu still isn't acquiring keyboard focus immediately
    track down and remove all the places where keyboard focus is requested
    inappropriately, see juce_Component.cpp:2766

-Acquiring global resources from PocketHomeApplication doesn't make them any less
global, it just adds an unnecessary extra dependency.  Just make properly
thread-safe singleton classes to handle shared resources that are too expensive
to generate more than once.

-Window focus management needs a clean interface that can be reused, that works
even if the PocketHomeWindow isn't initialized.

-Design and implement TabbedAppMenu
	wait on this until nested folders are implemented and tested.


-prevent battery widget from showing percentages over 100
    -perhaps run battery.sh in these cases?

-Make bluetooth work and properly implement the bluetooth page
    -Adapt bluetooth code from 
        https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/tree/client/main.c
        
-Re-add the IP label to the Settings Page (or optionally, the homepage)

-Define page background color/image in config

-more options for updating the config within the UI

-localization support

-configurable keyboard shortcuts on input page

-More thorough implementation of the Desktop entry standard


-SwitchComponent needs an update and documentation. Consider using svg
assets to define it.

-PopupEditorComponent subclasses shouldn't need to directly access its data members.

-ConfigurableImageButton shouldn't need to access the DrawableImageButton's
 internal image component.
