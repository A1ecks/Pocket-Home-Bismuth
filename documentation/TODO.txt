Fetching categories is broken now, fix ASAP 

-Move asset handling to AssetFile.h 

-Re-add the IP label to the Settings Page
    -Add option to display the IP label on the home page

-localization support

-Centralize Page management in the PageStack, loading pages dynamically shortly 
    before they're needed
    -Save memory by only allocating pages when they're on the stack or 
accessible from the top page
    -Finally eliminate the need for most global resources by allowing resources 
        to be passed directly to where they're needed, instead of through a 
        chain of pages that only need them in order to pass them on.
    -possibly use a Factory design pattern? Page creation and resource 
        allocation doesn't need to be tied directly to the PageStack

-Configurables in general could use an overhaul, they need more safeguards to
 ensure they're removed from their ConfigFiles if deleted.
