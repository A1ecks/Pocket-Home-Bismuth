\subsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{classWindowFocusedTimer}{Window\+Focused\+Timer}} is a Juce timer that is guaranteed to stop whenever \mbox{\hyperlink{classPocketHomeWindow}{Pocket\+Home\+Window}} loses focus, and resume whenever it regains focus. This should reduce the amount that this application wastes C\+PU cycles while it\textquotesingle{}s running in the background. ~\newline
 Suspended timers save their next scheduled runtime, not the amount of time left on the timer, so timers that would have ended while suspended will immediately call their timer\+Callback when resumed.
