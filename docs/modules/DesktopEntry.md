## DesktopEntry Module Documentation ##
Desktop entry files are a standardized form of shared application shortcut used 
on Linux desktops. The DesktopEntry module loads these files into data objects,
and provides an interface for reading, updating, and changing desktop entry 
data.

See https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html
for the full desktop entry specification.
