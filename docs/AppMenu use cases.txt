Creating the Menu:
    -Create, add and make visible: AppMenu::MainComponent mainCmp
    -Call mainCmp.showMenuType(paged)
        -mainCmp initializes "control" data member as a PageMenuController
            -control initializes data member "inputHandler" as a
             PageInputHandler
            -control initializes data member "menuCmp" as a PageMenuComponent 
            -control calls inputHandler:addMenuComponent, adding a reference to
             
        -mainCmp calls control->addMenuComponent(), adding menuCmp as a 
         visible child component to mainCmp
