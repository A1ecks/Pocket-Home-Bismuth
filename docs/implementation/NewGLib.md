# Creating GLib Object Classes (WIP)
Include a brief description here of GLib's object system and why it's obnoxious to work with directly.

1. Borrowed vs. Owned objects
2. Creating property access functions.
3. Creating GLib function wrappers.
4. Managing GLib pointers with RAII techniques.
5. Handling GLib object signals.
