\subsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{classResourceManager}{Resource\+Manager}} is an abstract class that provides a framework for classes that share a single resource between all class instances. 

This shared resource inherits from \mbox{\hyperlink{classResourceManager_1_1SharedResource}{Resource\+Manager\+::\+Shared\+Resource}}. When a subclass of \mbox{\hyperlink{classResourceManager}{Resource\+Manager}} is instantiated, the Shared\+Resource will only be created if no other instance of that class exists. That shared resource will only be destroyed when the last instance of its \mbox{\hyperlink{classResourceManager}{Resource\+Manager}} is destroyed.

As this application is multi-\/threaded, all Shared\+Resource implementations should disallow concurrent access.
