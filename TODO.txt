-Access points with a shared connection are no longer being combined, fix that.
	-Compare SavedConnection objects based on path

-Updating saved connection passwords is barely tested and very broken.

-Connections occasionally briefly dip into a failed state before connection,
  use timeouts instead of immediately sending the failure signal

-Remove disconnection signal call from the wifi state manager, instead try
  only calling it when the active connection changes to null.

-Remove connection signal from the AP update callback, only send it on relevant
  state changes

-Rework DBus method error handling, pass errors back to the calling method

-Wifi connection page occasionally goes blank during connection/disconnection

-Connecting/Disconnecting sometimes fails to register with the connection
  page until it is closed and reopened.

-Add visible AP change callback so the connection page can dynamically update
  the access point list

-Add detailed AP info to the connections page.

-Animate connection page transitions.

-Update the HomePage wifi icon to better use new wifi features.

-Build a fully threadsafe signaller/listener pattern for SharedResource objects.

-Finish documenting and formatting AppMenu helper classes.

-Set password page isn`t hiding the current password field!

-Look into PolicyKit api for requesting privileges, add application specific
  policies for bluetooth and the password file.

 automatically

-Define page background color/image in config
     Replace the background selector on HomePageSettings 

-Text height shouldn't be in configuration as a component.
